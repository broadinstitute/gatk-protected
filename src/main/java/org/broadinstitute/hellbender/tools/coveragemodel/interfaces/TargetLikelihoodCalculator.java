/**
 * Calculate log-likelihoods of observed coverage as a function of copy ratio.  This is needed for
 * likelihood-based segmentation and calling of CNVs, for example our HMM for germline CNVs.
 *
 * In this generic interface, {@code likelihoodData} can represent any type of data that is required
 * for calculating the likelihood function at a target. For example, the likelihood could represent
 * the emission probability to different copy number states.
 *
 * In particular, it could represent "raw" integer read counts (cast to double), "proportional coverage"
 * normalized by average depth, log-coverage, or denoised "tangent-normalized" coverage obtained by
 * subtracting noise principal components.
 *
 * @param <D> type of data required for calculating the likelihood
