/**
 * This caller is considered experimental.
 *
 * Simple caller that
 * 1) estimates the value of normalized coverage corresponding to copy neutral segments
 * This value is not necessarily equal to zero.  For example, a large amplification on one segment
 * depresses the proportional coverage of all other segments.
 * 2) estimates the variance of targets' normalized coverage within a segment, assuming that
 * this variance is globally shared by all segments
 * 3) calls each segment based on a p-value for the null hypothesis that its targets'
 * normalized coverages are drawn from a normal distribution defined by the mean from 1)
 * and the variance from 2)
 *
 * Note:  Assumes that the incoming target file is in log_2(CR)
 * Note:  Assumes that the incoming segment means are CR.
