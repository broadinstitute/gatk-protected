     * Contains private methods for small-segment merging.
     *
     * <p>
     *     The goal of small-segment merging is to merge all small segments (i.e., those with a number of targets below
     *     a given threshold) with adjacent segments.  This is done to match the output of circular binary segmentation,
     *     which does not generate segments with less than 3 targets.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     *     For each small segment, the question we want to answer is: which of the two adjacent segments (i.e., those to
     *     the left or right of the small segment in the center) is "closer" to the small segment, and hence, should be
     *     merged with the small segment?  We would like to determine this based on the target coverages, SNP allele
     *     counts, and genomic locations of each of the three segments; note that each segment may be missing either
     *     coverages or allele counts (but not both).
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     *     However, this question is not statistically well defined, so we will use the following ad-hoc procedure:
     *     <ol>
     *         <li>
     *             We first check that all segments are on the same chromosome.  If only one of the adjacent segments is
     *             on the same chromosome, it is merged with by default.  If neither of the adjacent segments is on the
     *             same chromosome, no merge is performed.
     *         </li>
     *         <li>
     *             We then examine SNP allele counts (as opposed to target coverages---this is because the center
     *             segment has a small number of targets, by construction, and so the ability to determine which segment
     *             is closer using target coverages is inherently limited).  In particular, we examine the empirical
     *             alternate-allele fractions in each of the segments; these should have a bimodal (unimodal)
     *             distribution for unbalanced (balanced) segemnts.  The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic, which
     *             measures the similarity of two data sets (it is zero (unity) for identical (dissimilar) data sets),
     *             is used to construct two distances between the alternate-allele fractions in the left and center
     *             segments and those in the right and center segments, respectively.  The distances are used to
     *             construct a pair of scores (with corrections for sizes of the data sets) for merging with the
     *             left and right segments, respectively; the sum of the scores is normalized to unity.  The adjacent
     *             segment with the higher score has alternate-allele fractions that are more similar, and hence it
     *             should be merged with the center small segment.
     *         </li>
     *         <li>
     *             However, if the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distances are not sufficiently dissimilar, if they are both close
     *             to unity (i.e., if the alternate-allele fractions in neither the left nor the right segment overlap
     *             significantly with those in the center segment), or if there are not enough SNPs to calculate the
     *             Kolmogorov-Smirnov distances (the Apache Commons implementation requires at least 2 data points
     *             in each data set), we instead use the empirical inverse minor-allele fractions (which, ideally,
     *             are proportional to total copy ratio and have a distribution that is practically unimodal) in each of
     *             the three segments.  Two distances between the two pairs of data sets are constructed using the
     *             Hodges-Lehmann estimator (which gives a measure of the difference in the location parameters of two
     *             data sets), and these distances are used to construct a pair of scores as above.
     *         </li>
     *         <li>
     *             If the scores generated from the SNP allele counts are too similar or if any of the segments is
     *             missing SNPs, then we attempt to use the target coverages instead.  Here, we simply use the
     *             Hodges-Lehmann estimator to construct two distances and a corresponding pair of scores as above.
     *         </li>
     *         <li>
     *             If the scores generated from the target coverages are too similar or if any of the segments is
     *             missing targets, we then simply use genomic distance (defined between adjacent breakpoints) to decide
     *             which adjacent segment is closer.  For consistency, we also convert the two genomic distances into a
     *             pair of scores that sum to unity.
     *         </li>
     *         <li>
     *             In the unlikely event that all of the above scores are equal, we randomly choose one of the adjacent
     *             segments and merge it with the center small segment.
     *         </li>
